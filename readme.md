# Bachelor Project:
## Algorithmic Pricing Collusion: Introducing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

All code for this project is found in the `code` directory. The code that produces all the relevant figures for the paper can be found in `graphs.ipynb`. The file `model.py` contains the demand, profit, and calculation of epsilon values. The files `q_lib.py`, `WoLF_lib.py`, and `JAL_AM_lib.py` are Python modules that implement Q-learning, WoLF-PHC, and JAL-AM algorithms in sequential Bertrand duopoly. The files `q_learning.ipynb`, `wolf_phc.ipynb`, and `JAL_AM.ipynb` are notebooks used for experimenting with the respective libraries.

To run the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
