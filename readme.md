# Bachelor Project:
## Algorithmic Pricing Collusion: Introducing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning

The code that produces all the relevant figures for the paper can be found in $\texttt{graphs.ipynb}$. The file $\texttt{model.py}$ contains the demand, profit and calculation of epsilon vales. The files $\texttt{q\_lib.py}$, $\texttt{WoLF\_lib.py}$ and $\texttt{JAL\_AM\_lib.py}$ are python modules that implement Q-learning, WoLF-PHC and JAL-AM algorithms in sequential Bertrand duopoly. The files $\texttt{q\_learning.ipynb}$, $\texttt{wolf\_phc.ipynb}$ and $\texttt{JAL\_AM.ipynb}$ are notebooks  used for experimenting the belonging library.  

To run the Jupyter Notebook ($\texttt{ipynb}$) files, you can use the Jupyter Notebook application from a distribution like Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/).
